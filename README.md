## üåê Travel Website

This is a simple, front-end travel website that showcases various tour destinations from around the world. It includes sections for popular and featured destinations, each with a short description and a "Book Now" button.

When users click "Book Now," a booking form appears in a pop-up window where they can enter their travel details. The form is fully functional on the front-end and provides instant feedback upon submission.

The website is built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to deploy and run on different platforms.
